        <p class="pstandard"> If an electric guitar is a painting, then its pickups are the paint. They are responsible for the existence of a guitar's sound characteristics while also determining the colour, depth and consistency of its audio signature. For tone-chasers, professional touring musicians, studio wizards and everything in between, having the right pickup models and arrangement is extremely important. </p>

        <p class="pstandard"> If you’ve ever played an electric guitar with the volume knob on its body turned all the way down, you’d know it has the same twangy, thin sound as if it were actually unplugged. By turning the dial to zero, you’ve disabled all the pickups in the guitar. Pickups are an important connective piece between the strumming of strings and the noise that actually comes out of an amp or headphones, so without them, nothing happens. </p>
        <p class="pstandard"> Fundamentally, electric guitars are a circuit. The player creates input by plucking or picking the strings, the sound is processed, and then we can hear the output through some sort of speaker. The obvious question mark here is that moving a piece of wire around doesn’t normally create voltage or current, two necessary parts of a circuit. That’s where pickups come in. </p>

        <p class="pstandard"> Guitar pickups utilize a physical electromagnetic rule called Faraday’s Law of Electromagnetic Induction, which states that “a changing magnetic field induces a voltage in a circuit”. This allows pickups, which are essentially magnets coiled with a copper wire, to generate a voltage. This principle is demonstrated in Figure 1, an official diagram of a Seymour-Duncan single coil pickup. </p>
        <p class="pstandard"> This pickup comprises a main "frame", called a bobbin (the bottom of which is labeled as “Base plate” in the diagram), six bar magnets, (usually neodymium or alnico) and copper wire coiled around the main body. When placed in a guitar, each magnet lies beneath one of the six strings (Figure 3 - insert?) - this allows each string to be “heard” with a good amount of detail. </p>
        <p class="pstandard"> When a string is played, its vibrations interfere with the pickup’s magnetic field as per Faraday’s Law of Electromagnetic Induction. This creates a voltage with AC (alternating current) inside of the copper coil which mimics the frequency of the string that’s played - it’s almost like the note is “heard” and “recorded” by the pickup in the form of an electrical signal, which is sent and further processed by amplifiers, pedals, and the like. </p>
